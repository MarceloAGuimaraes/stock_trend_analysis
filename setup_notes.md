# System Setup Notes

## Virtual Environment Setup

This is just a small note for the setup process to integrate a virtual environment as kernel into the global jupyter installation.

1. Create the virtual environment: `python3 virtualenv .venv`
2. Activate the virtual env `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install everything required `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Download the files from the google drive link ([text](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1wAL7pEST0MeCtJytRNbGba2mez_nBwK5))
5. Enter the lib folder `cd lib`
6. Run the recommender `python content_based_recommender.py`
