# Recommender Library

The library is constructed to help with data gathering and pre-processing regarding the various sources of stock data. It has the general components:

* contrib - contains helper code, like API access functions
* learning - Preprocessing for models (later on also actual models)
* news - Functions to gather news information related to specific companies
* stocks - Various wrapper classes that allow to access different APIs for access to stock information (`Ticker`) and statement data (`Statements`)
* utils - Various helper functions used throughout the library

> Note: I have planned to extend the library with code for actual model training, but this is currently in future work

We will look at the most relevant parts of the library in detail. All functions also have doc-strings that should be self-explanatory.
